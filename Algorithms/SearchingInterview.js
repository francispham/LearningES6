/*
1. If you know a solution is not far form the Root of the Tree: BFS

2. if the Tree is very Deep and Solution are Rare: BFS (DFS will take very long)

3. If the Tree is very wide: DFS (BFS will need too much Memory)

4. If Solutions are frequent but located Deep in the Tree: DFS

5. Determining whether a Path exists between two Nodes: DFS

6. Finding the Shortest Path: BFS

## Functional Programming

### Notes

1. Functions are Values
2. Less Codes Always means Less Bugs
3. Functions that take other Functions as their Arguments are called Higher Order Functions
4. HOF Filter is a Method on the Array Object that takes another Function as its Arguments and uses that Function to Filter the Array
5. HOF Map will take an Array and return a new Array of the same length but with each individual Item Transformed

6. HOF Reduce is extremely powerful List Transformation that it can replace all of the HOFs including Filter, Map, Reject, Find...
7. Reduce Method will take a Callback Function and an Object (as a Starting Point) as its' Arguments
